# Image_Processing_Project
A Python project that demonstrates image processing techniques using OpenCV. Covers grayscale conversion, thresholding, edge detection, noise filtering, morphological operations, and image restoration.


This repository includes two parts:
  Grayscale & Thresholding
  Segmentation & Filtering

The techniques used include:
  Image conversion to RGB & Grayscale 
  Application of Thresholding 
  Edge detection with Canny Edge Detection 
  Morphological operations (Erosion, Dilation) 
  Application of Gaussian noise and its removal
  Inpainting for image repair 
  RGB & HSV histogram calculation

Libraries required: scikit, matplotlib, numpy, opencv
